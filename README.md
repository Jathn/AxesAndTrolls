# üõ°Axes & Trolls

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Overview
Axes & Trolls is a strategy game that combines old and new strategy features from board games into a videogame. Local Play with friends to battle out is the current way to go. With this in mind, new features and extensibility is welcome.

Features:
- Play 1-4 players locally - old school style: You've got the red, the blue, the green and the yellow player
- Strategy game where the goal is expansion
- In-Game economy with 3 different resources: Gold, Wood and Food - all with their specific purpose
- Different units with different strengths

## Technical details

The game was developed using C++ combined with the SFML library. Its main goal was creating a game from scratch, for practice and for fun.

The source code provides some solutions (some worse, but hopefully some better) for among other things these:
- Map generation (with clustering of different area types.)
- Tile system
- Path finding
- Unit type specific rules
- Turn and turn phase handling
and a lot of other unexpected features that needed implementing.
